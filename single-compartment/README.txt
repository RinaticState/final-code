Run the solver.m file to generate graphs of:
1. Beta cells, glucose, insulin
2. Effector, regulatory, memory t-cells
3. Apoptotic beta cells, necrotic beta cells, immunogenic dendritic cells, and tolerogenic dendritic cells

Parameters are stored in the params.m file and ODEs are stored in the rhs.m file.
