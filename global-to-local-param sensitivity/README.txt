This code simulates the multi compartmental model and changes on parameter at a time by the desired percent. Use this code by calling the function parambarplot(finalday,percentchange,wave).  That is, if you want it to run 100 days, change each parameter by 5%, with a wave, you call at the Matlab prompt: parambarplot(100,5,1).  It is slow to run, but it will make a nice plot for you.
